Feathers-Quiz-Microservice
By Steve Sande, adapted from Traversy Media https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y33WCVkLwc

This project is the foundation of a multiple choice quiz delivery service.
It was written to gain familiarity with web dev technologies.
The questions are stored using a Feathers.js microservice and local memory.
When the microservice is stopped all data is lost.
The user has CRUD access through an admin page.
Only admin functionality has been implemented thus far because that fulfilled the main learning goals and timeline of the project.
Future additions or improvements are possible if it makes sense.

To use:
"npm start" to start the service.
"Go Live" using the Go Live extension to access the admin page.
